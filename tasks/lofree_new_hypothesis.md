# New Hypothesis: Why sinowealth-kb-tool Fails with Lofree Flow Lite

## The Real Issue

After extensive testing and research, I believe the issue is NOT that Lofree uses a completely different protocol, but rather:

1. **The device is ALREADY in bootloader mode** (VID:PID = 0x3554:0xF808)
2. **sinowealth-kb-tool expects to switch a device FROM normal mode TO bootloader mode**
3. **The tool's ISP protocol implementation may not handle devices that start in bootloader mode**

## Supporting Evidence

1. **Standard Chip**: The firmware header confirms it's a CX53730 chip
2. **Business Logic**: No manufacturer would create a custom protocol for a standard chip
3. **Device State**: The device shows bootloader VID/PID (F808) not runtime VID/PID (F811)
4. **Tool Behavior**: sinowealth-kb-tool tries to "enter ISP mode" but device is already there

## Why It Fails

1. **macOS HID Error 0xE0005000**: This appears when trying to send reports to a device that doesn't expect them
2. **No Feature Reports**: The device has no feature report IDs (used by the tool for device detection)
3. **Report ID Mismatch**: Tool expects report IDs 5 & 6 for CMD/XFER, but device only accepts 6

## Possible Solutions

### 1. Try Existing Tools Differently

Since the device is already in bootloader mode, try tools designed for devices that start in DFU/bootloader:

```bash
# Try dfu-util (if it's actually DFU compatible)
brew install dfu-util
dfu-util -l  # List DFU devices

# Try hidapi tools directly
brew install hidapi
hidapitester --vidpid 3554:F808 --list-detail
```

### 2. Modify sinowealth-kb-tool

The tool might work if we:
- Skip the "enter ISP mode" step
- Go directly to flash operations
- Use the correct report structure

### 3. Check Windows Behavior

The official Windows tool likely:
- Detects the device is already in bootloader mode
- Uses the appropriate protocol for that state
- Doesn't try to switch modes

## Next Experiment

Create a minimal tool that:
1. Opens the device (already in bootloader)
2. Tries standard ISP write commands WITHOUT mode switching
3. Uses report ID 6 only

This would test if the protocol is standard but the tool's flow is wrong.
