# Attempts to Fix Windows App Detection

## Problem
The Lofree Windows app cannot detect the keyboard even though it's connected and visible to the system.

## Findings from Config.ini

1. **Interface Mismatch**: Config has `Interface=1` but our tests show device is on interface 0
2. **Empty KB_PID**: The `KB_PID` field is empty, might need bootloader PID
3. **VID/PID Already Present**: The bootloader PID (F808) is already in D_PID list

## Suggested Config Modifications

### 1. Change Interface to 0
```ini
Interface=0
```

### 2. Add Bootloader PID to KB_PID
```ini
KB_PID=RjgwOA==
```
(This is base64 for "F808")

### 3. Try Only Bootloader PID in D_PID
Remove other PIDs to force detection of only bootloader:
```ini
D_PID=RjgwOA==
```

### 4. Increase Debug Level
```ini
Debug=3
```

## Alternative Approaches

1. **Check Windows Device Manager**
   - Ensure device shows as "USB Input Device" with VID 3554, PID F808
   - May need to uninstall and reinstall device

2. **Try Different USB Ports**
   - Some bootloaders are sensitive to USB hub vs direct port

3. **Run as Administrator**
   - Windows HID access sometimes requires admin rights

4. **Check for Multiple Config Files**
   - The app might be reading from a different location
   - Check AppData folders

5. **Registry Entries**
   - Windows apps sometimes cache device info in registry
   - May need to clear old entries
