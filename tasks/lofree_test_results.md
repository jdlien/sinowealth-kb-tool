# Lofree Flow Lite Test Results

## Summary of Findings

### 1. Device Communication
- **Interface**: Device is on interface 0 (not 1 as config suggests)
- **Report ID**: Device accepts report ID 0x06 for writes
- **Write Success**: Device accepts writes but provides no responses
- **Feature Reports**: Device rejects all feature report requests

### 2. Protocol Analysis
- Device does NOT respond to standard Sinowealth ISP commands
- No response to any tested command patterns including:
  - Standard Sinowealth commands (0x75, 0x52, 0x83, etc.)
  - Common bootloader patterns
  - Magic bytes from firmware container (Q$UU)
  - Various packet sizes (6, 12, 48 bytes)

### 3. Key Observations
1. **Already in Bootloader Mode**: Device VID/PID (0x3554:0xF808) indicates it's already in bootloader
2. **Protocol Mismatch**: The Lofree bootloader uses a completely different protocol than standard Sinowealth
3. **No Handshake**: Device doesn't provide any response to help identify the correct protocol

### 4. Test Tool Created
Created `lofree_test_tool.rs` that:
- Systematically tests different command patterns
- Tries multiple report IDs and packet sizes
- Can be extended with new command patterns as we learn more

## Next Steps

### Safe Recovery Options
1. **Use Official Software**: The safest path remains using the official Lofree Key Mapper on Windows
2. **Contact Lofree**: Reach out to Lofree support for protocol documentation

### Research Options (if you get another Flow Lite)
1. **USB Traffic Capture**: Capture communication during official firmware update
2. **Reverse Engineering**: Further analysis of the Windows DLL with proper RE tools
3. **Community Help**: Check if anyone else has documented the Lofree protocol

### Experimental Options (HIGH RISK)
1. **Brute Force Commands**: Systematically try more command patterns
2. **Analyze Firmware Structure**: The firmware uses ComUsbUpgradeFile container - analyze its structure
3. **Try Different Interfaces**: Although interface 0 works, could try claiming interface 1

## Technical Details

### Report Descriptor Analysis
```
Report ID 0x06: 48 bytes, vendor-specific usage (0xff02)
Report ID 0xB0: Consumer control usage
```

### Firmware Structure
```
Magic: Q$UU (0x51 0x24 0x55 0x55)
Header: 720 bytes
Payload: 57,064 bytes (firmware data)
Memory Layout: 61,440 bytes firmware + 4,096 bytes bootloader
```

## Conclusion

Without the ability to capture USB traffic or proper protocol documentation, we cannot safely determine the correct update protocol. The device is clearly using a proprietary protocol that differs significantly from the standard Sinowealth ISP protocol that sinowealth-kb-tool implements.
