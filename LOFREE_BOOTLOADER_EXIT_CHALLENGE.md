# Lofree Flow Lite Bootloader Exit - Current Challenge

## Problem Statement
After successfully updating firmware, the Lofree Flow Lite keyboard remains stuck in bootloader mode (3554:F808) instead of returning to runtime mode (05AC:024F).

## What We've Accomplished
1. ✅ Successfully switch from runtime to bootloader mode
2. ✅ Successfully write firmware (65,224 bytes)
3. ❌ Device stays in bootloader mode after firmware update

## Current Bootloader Exit Implementation

### From New Capture Analysis (lofree-flow-lite-key-mapper-upgrade-capture.pcapng)
We identified what we believed was the bootloader exit command:
```
06b1c108000800f4c000000000000000009122e5bd9c945a63ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
```

### Our Implementation
```rust
fn lofree_finalize(&self) -> Result<(), ISPError> {
    // Send the exact bootloader exit command from capture analysis
    let exit_cmd = vec![
        0x06, // Report ID
        0xb1, 0xc1, 0x08, 0x00, 0x08, 0x00, 0xf4, 0xc0, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
        0x91, 0x22, 0xe5, 0xbd, 0x9c, 0x94, 0x5a, 0x63, 
        0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff, // ... padding to 65 bytes
    ];
    
    self.cmd_device.send_feature_report(&exit_cmd)?;
    thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(2000));
}
```

## What We've Tried

### 1. Original Wireshark Finalization Sequence
From the first capture, we saw:
```
065bb505000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
065bb588000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```
**Result**: Commands sent successfully but device remains in bootloader

### 2. Gap-Hunt Guide Sequence
Added additional reboot command:
```
065bb599000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```
**Result**: No effect

### 3. New Capture Exit Command
Implemented the exact command from Key Mapper capture:
```
06b1c108000800f4c000000000000000009122e5bd9c945a63ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
```
**Result**: Command sends but device stays in bootloader

### 4. DLL Analysis Commands
Tried various keyboard enable codes based on DLL reverse engineering:
- 0x6A, 0x77, 0x88, 0xAA, 0xBB, 0xCC
**Result**: No effect

### 5. LJMP Footer Implementation
Added proper LJMP footer at firmware_size-5:
```
02 00 00 [CRC_LO] [CRC_HI]
```
**Result**: Footer written correctly but doesn't trigger bootloader exit

## Analysis of the Issue

### Firmware Write Confirmation
- Firmware writes successfully (65,224 bytes)
- LJMP footer added at correct offset (0xF2BB)
- CRC16 calculated and included

### Possible Issues

1. **Wrong Exit Command Structure**
   - The `b1c1` command might not be the exit trigger
   - Could be part of the final data write, not a separate command

2. **Missing Sequence Steps**
   - Official tool might send additional commands we haven't captured
   - Timing between commands might be critical

3. **Incorrect Command Delivery**
   - Using `send_feature_report()` but might need different transfer type
   - Report ID or interface might be wrong

4. **Firmware Validation**
   - Device might be rejecting the firmware due to:
     - Wrong CRC calculation
     - Incorrect firmware structure
     - Missing signature or validation data

5. **Device State**
   - Bootloader might need specific state before accepting exit
   - Could require successful verification step we're missing

## Next Investigation Steps

### 1. Analyze Complete Firmware Update Sequence
Need to examine the entire firmware update process from the successful capture:
- Every command after firmware write
- Exact timing between commands
- Any read/verification commands

### 2. Compare Firmware Structure
- Extract firmware from official tool update
- Compare with our written firmware
- Verify LJMP footer placement and CRC

### 3. Test Alternative Exit Methods
- Try different command structures
- Test various timing delays
- Experiment with different interfaces/endpoints

### 4. Capture New Traces
- Use official tool with known working firmware
- Capture complete USB traffic including all endpoints
- Look for any missed commands or responses

## Current Device State
- VID: 3554, PID: F808 (Bootloader mode)
- Firmware written but not activated
- Device functional as HID but stuck in DFU
- Requires power cycle to attempt normal boot (which fails)

## Request for Analysis
We need to understand:
1. The exact mechanism that triggers bootloader exit
2. Why the device accepts firmware but won't boot it
3. What validation the bootloader performs before exiting
4. The complete command sequence after firmware write

The device successfully switches TO bootloader mode and accepts firmware, but won't switch back to runtime mode despite trying multiple documented exit methods.
